# Rust URL Shortener Service

A simple yet powerful web service built with Rust and Axum that shortens long URLs. This application allows you to create short, manageable links that redirect to their original long-form destinations.

This project was developed as a practical exercise to master key backend development concepts in Rust, including asynchronous programming, database interaction, and building robust APIs.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Modern API:** Built with the fast and ergonomic **Axum** web framework.
* **Persistent Storage:** Uses **SQLite** for durable, file-based storage of URL mappings.
* **Safe Database Access:** Leverages **SQLx** for compile-time checked, asynchronous, and safe SQL queries.
* **Asynchronous-First:** Fully asynchronous from the web layer to the database, powered by **Tokio**.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Utilizes `anyhow` for clean and unified error management.
