# Rust URL Shortener Service

A simple yet powerful web service built with Rust and Axum that shortens long URLs. This application allows you to create short, manageable links that redirect to their original long-form destinations.

This project was developed as a practical exercise to master key backend development concepts in Rust, including asynchronous programming, database interaction, and building robust APIs.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Modern API:** Built with the fast and ergonomic **Axum** web framework.
* **Persistent Storage:** Uses **SQLite** for durable, file-based storage of URL mappings.
* **Safe Database Access:** Leverages **SQLx** for compile-time checked, asynchronous, and safe SQL queries.
* **Asynchronous-First:** Fully asynchronous from the web layer to the database, powered by **Tokio**.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Utilizes `anyhow` for clean and unified error management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Language:** [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* **Web Framework:** [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)
* **Async Runtime:** [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/)
* **Database:** [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
* **Database Toolkit:** [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx)
* **Serialization/Deserialization:** [Serde](https://serde.rs/)
* **Random Code Generation:** [Rand](https://crates.io/crates/rand)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* You must have the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (including `rustc` and `cargo`) installed.

### Installation & Setup

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/url-shortener.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/url-shortener.git)
    cd url-shortener
    ```

2.  Build the project and download all dependencies:
    ```sh
    cargo build
    ```

3.  Run the application. The SQLite database file (`urls.db`) will be created automatically on the first run.
    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```
    The server will start listening on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Usage

The service exposes two main endpoints.

### 1. Shorten a New URL

* **Endpoint:** `POST /shorten`
* **Request Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "url": "[https://your-very-long-url.com/with/some/path](https://your-very-long-url.com/with/some/path)"
    }
    ```
* **Example with `curl`:**
    ```sh
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "[https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/)"}' [http://127.0.0.1:3000/shorten](http://127.0.0.1:3000/shorten)
    ```
* **Success Response (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "short_url": "http://localhost:3000/aB1cD2"
    }
    ```

### 2. Redirect to the Original URL

* **Endpoint:** `GET /:id`
    * Where `:id` is the short code generated by the `/shorten` endpoint.
* **Example:**
    * Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/aB1cD2`.
* **Result:**
    * You will be automatically redirected to the original long URL (e.g., `https://www.rust-lang.org/`).
    * If the short code is not found, the server will respond with a `404 Not Found` error.
